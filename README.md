Here are python notebooks for calculations in Ball Circular Accelerator of G12.

- Ball_Launcher_calc.ipynb is for dynamics i.e. inertia, torque, and power.
- BCA_projectile_calc.ipynb is for projectile and optimization analysis, including trajectory equation and error on varying parameters.

- The mirror of the files can be accessed in Drive at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WK5dm9VfO8SiX96l44j8UK4AKhMxwBke?usp=sharing for conveniently accessing with COLAB via mobile device. They shall be updated for some time.
